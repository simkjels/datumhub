Datum is an open infrastructure project for making public data truly public.

---

## The problem

Across the world, enormous amounts of valuable data is published every day —
research findings, financial disclosures, public records, environmental reports.
Most of it disappears into download pages, email attachments, and broken links.

There is no common standard for how public data should be shared.
No guarantee that what you download today is the same as what was published yesterday.
No way to know if a file has been tampered with or quietly updated.

---

## What Datum does

Datum gives every published file a **permanent address**, a **version**, and a
**verifiable fingerprint**. Publishers keep full control of their data —
it stays on their own servers. Datum simply provides the standard that
makes it findable, trustworthy, and reusable.

> Anyone can publish. Anyone can access.

---

## Why it matters

Open data only creates value when it can actually be used.

| Without Datum | With Datum |
|---|---|
| Reports buried in government portals | Every file has a permanent, stable address |
| No way to track changes over time | Every release is versioned |
| No way to verify what you downloaded | Every file has a verifiable fingerprint |
| Scattered across servers and inboxes | Discoverable through a single open registry |

---

## Vision

- 🌍 A public registry at [datumhub.org](https://datumhub.org) open to any publisher
- 🔓 A neutral, open standard that no single organisation controls
- 🏛️ Infrastructure that works for governments, institutions, and individuals alike
- 🔧 No lock-in — any organisation can run their own registry

---

## Status

> **Early development.** Developer tools are functional. DatumHub — the public registry — is coming.
